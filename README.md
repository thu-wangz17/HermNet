# HermNet
Heterogeneous relational message passing networks (```HermNet```)

**Note: The code of `HermNet` is refactored from `DGL`-based to `PYG`-based because of the efficiency. Some codes are still unfinished and the related codes have not been tested.**

## Architecture
Three kinds of HermNet are proposed, i.e. Heterogeneous Vertex Networks (HVNet), Heterogeneous Pair Networks (HPNet), Heterogeneous Triadic Networks (HTNet). `HermNet` is inspired by [`LAMMPS`](https://lammps.sandia.gov/), whose [`pair_style`](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pairs.html) could be set as [`hybrid`](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_hybrid.html), which is self-consistent with heterogeneous. The entire architecture of `HermNet` is displayed as follows,

The subgraphs are extracted with the following operations, 
![](./figs/subgraph.svg)

The sub-network used in the manuscript is a modified and simplified [PAINN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03150), which is shown as follows,

## Requirements
The following libraries are required:
```
PyTorch
Numpy
Torch_geometric
Ase
```
The code has been tested with the libraries whose versions could be found in [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt).
